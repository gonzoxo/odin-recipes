    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. 
        It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>
        <p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days. 
            Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

           <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>

            <li>1/2 large pepper (green, red, or yellow)</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
